# Job_search_H1B

This is made to help in my job search with limited no of companies sponsoring H1B. 


## How to make this application run 
### Download the following files :
* Home_page.py
* pages Directory as a whole 

Step 2 : Put home page and the pages directory in a same folder <br />
step 3 : Make sure python is installed and install all the dependencies in the requirements.txt if not present already <br />
step 4 : From the terminal (for mac) use cd command to change directory to where Home_page.py is present <br />
step 5: use commmand 'streamlit run Home_page.py' to launch the application <br />
And the application should be launched in your default browser. If not, use the LOCAL URL shown in the terminal like shown in the picture below. <br />

Once application is launched, Home page has the directions to use and select the **Explore Companies** tab to find top companies sponsoring H1B and  **Finding Your Company** tab to find if the company of your interest sponsors and also if there are any recent openings 

## GOOD LUCK !
